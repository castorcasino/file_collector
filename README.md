Project File Collector

This project aims to improve the user's capability to organize files in his/her repository and analyze it manually for now. The idea is to get target file types from one source directory and move it to a dump directory.

The app shall know if the file in transit is already there in the destination directory and will apend "Copy_of_" to the filename so it will not overwrite the already copied file.

What the APP does (for now)...

APP should be able to identify the source directory
If the directory does not exist then the APPlication shall terminate execution.
APP should be able to identify for the types of files that it is looking for.
APP should be able to identify and list all files in the current and all sub-directories of the given source.
Make a master list of files.
Make a count of files to be copied.
To be continued...
